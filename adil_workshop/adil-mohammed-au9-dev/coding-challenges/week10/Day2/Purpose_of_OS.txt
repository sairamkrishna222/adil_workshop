QUESTION:


Explain the main purpose of an operating system?



ANSWER:

	An Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the user and computer hardware. 
	The purpose of an operating system is to provide a platform on which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

	An operating system is a piece of software that manages the allocation of computer hardware. 
	The coordination of the hardware must be appropriate to ensure the correct working of 
	the computer system and to prevent user programs 
	from interfering with the proper working of the system.
	The main goal of the Operating System is to thus make the computer environment more convenient to use 
	and the secondary goal is to use the resources in the most efficient manner.
