Q
    What are the components of a process?



Answer:
      

      These components reflect the services made available by the O.S.

1 Process Management:

        Process is a program in execution --- numerous processes to choose from in a multiprogrammed system,

	Process creation/deletion (bookkeeping)

	Process suspension/resumption (scheduling, system vs. user)

	Process synchronization

	Process communication

	Deadlock handling

2 Memory Management: 

	Maintain bookkeeping information

	Map processes to memory locations

	Allocate/deallocate memory space as requested/required

3 I/O Device Management:

	Disk management functions such as free space management, storage allocation, fragmentation removal, head scheduling

	Consistent, convenient software to I/O device interface through buffering/caching, custom drivers for each device.


4 File System:

     Built on top of disk management

	File creation/deletion.

	Support for hierarchical file systems

	Update/retrieval operations: read, write, append, seek

	Mapping of files to secondary storage

5. Protection:

      Controlling access to the system

	Resources --- CPU cycles, memory, files, devices

	Users --- authentication, communication

	Mechanisms, not policies

6. Network Management:

   Often built on top of file system

	TCP/IP, IPX, IPng

	Connection/Routing strategies

	``Circuit'' management --- circuit, message, packet switching

	Communication mechanism

	Data/Process migration


7. User Interface:

	Character-Oriented shell --- sh, csh, command.com ( User replaceable)

	GUI --- X, Windows 95
