                The dog is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids,<br>
                and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are,<br> 
                sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,,<br>
                which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.,<br>

                The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a<br> 
                subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like<br>
                canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray<br>
                wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13][14]<br>
                which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,<br>
                [14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]
