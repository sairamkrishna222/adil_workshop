    <h1>Task Runner</h1>
    <p>Task runners are the heroes (or villains, depending on your point of view) that quietly toil behind most web and mobile applications. Task runners provide value through the automation of numerous development tasks such as concatenating files, spinning up development servers and compiling code. In this article, we’ll cover Grunt, Gulp, Webpack and npm scripts. We’ll also provide some examples of each one to get you started. Near the end, I’ll throw out some easy wins and tips for integrating ideas from this post into your application.</p>
    <h1>Web Pack</h1>
    <p>webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler.[ It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

        Webpack takes the dependencies and generates a dependency graph allowing web developers to use a modular approach for their web application development purposes. It can be used from the command line, or can be configured using a config file which is named webpack.config.js. This file is used to define rules, plugins, etc., for a project. (webpack is highly extensible via rules which allow developers to write custom tasks that they want to perform when bundling files together.)
        
        Node.js is required for using webpack.
        
        webpack provides code on demand using the moniker code splitting. The Technical Committee 39 for ECMAScript is working on standardization of a function that loads additional code: "proposal-dynamic-import".</p>
    <h1>Why Task runner and Webpack is used:</h1>
    <p>Simply put, Webpack is such a powerful tool that it can already perform the vast majority of the tasks you'd otherwise do through a task runner. For instance, Webpack already provides options for minification and sourcemaps for your bundle.
    </p>
    <p>Webpack and Browserify are package bundlers. Basically, they are designed to run through all of a package's dependencies and concatenate their source into one file that (ideally) can be used in a browser. They are important to modern web development, because we use so many libraries that are designed to run with Node.</p>
