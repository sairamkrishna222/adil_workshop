Q1. What is the time complexity of the following code :
a = 0, i = N
while i > 0:
a += i
i /= 2



Answer : O(n)
Because the given i = N int question N = Constant 





Q2 What is the time complexity of the following code
i = n / 2
 while i < n:
 j = 2
 while j < n:
 j *= 2

Answer: logn
Because the given  question having nested while  

Q3.
 count = 0;
 i = N
 while i > 0:
 While j < i:
 count+=1
 i /= 2

Answer : nlogn
The given question have two while the N is running two times one is contant and other  is dividing the N
