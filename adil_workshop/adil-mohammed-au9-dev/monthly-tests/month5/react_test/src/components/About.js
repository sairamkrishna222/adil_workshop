          <p>
            When I graduated from Oxford I realised how much I had left to
            learn. A traditional education had given me specialised knowledge
            but hadn't set me up with the skills needed to succeed in an
            environment of constant change.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            So I set out on a journey to answer the question "What knowledge and
            skills do I need to thrive in the 21st century,{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Meta Learn</span> is my map of that journey. I've documented
            everything I've learned from years of personal study and
            conversations with some of the world's top experts in a range of
            fields from philosophy to technology, and psychology to business.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience has taught me that there's a wealth of great
            information out there... but it can be hard to absorb and convert it
            into genuine knowledge and understanding that can be applied in
            daily life.{" "}

          Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side, 
          in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net,
           trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents' playing area before 
           it can be returned..{" "}
